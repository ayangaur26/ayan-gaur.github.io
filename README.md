## **About me**
I'm an AI/ML enthusiast who thrives on solving complex problems through innovative technology. My journey started with a passion for machine learning and deep learning, and since then, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, from sensitive data discovery to computer vision applications in financial security. I love diving into data, building models, and optimizing solutions that create real-world impact.

I’m excited to continue pushing the boundaries of AI/ML and applying these technologies in impactful ways - whether in financial systems, healthcare, or other industries that can benefit from data-driven innovation.

I’m intrigued by ML and AI models and their applications in Quantitative Analysis, I also have an interest in Cryptography and Cybersecurity and its uses in Blockchain Security. I want to gain  knowledge about these areas and more fields in Computer Science and Mathematics. My goal is to create something helpful for everyone that can improve and make everyone's life easier.

## Education
I'm a third year undergraduate student studying Mathematics & Computer Science at UC San Diego. 
I have also completed a Machine Learning Foundations Certificate from Cornell University.

## Experience

### 3. Break Through Tech Machine Learning @ UCLA AI/ML Fellow
- Selected from 3000+ applicants, learnt data handling and preprocessing techniques, using Pandas for efficient data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
- Developed proficiency in training machine learning models using scikit-learn. Achieved an average model accuracy of 92% across various datasets, with hyperparameter tuning increasing model performance by 15% on average
- Implemented a diverse range of models such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, ensemble methods, deep learning, and neural networks, gaining experience in model selection and reducing loss by 20% through effective model selection
- Created and evaluated various machine learning models weekly to ensure high performance on unseen data, consistently achieving over 85% accuracy in validation tests and reducing overfitting by implementing regularization techniquesn data

### 4. UJIMA S&P Lab (Professor Imani Munyaka) Research Assistant
-	Developed a web-app for an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure an individual's level of bias toward autism 
- Created a prototype on OpenSesame and used Flask to recreate the IAT as a web-app written in Python
- Worked on the backend integration of the web-app to store and get reasonable insights from the survey
- Used the insights to contribute to Professor Munyaka’s anti-autistic hate speech detection project

### 5. ITA Workshop App Developer
- Developed a mobile application using Flutter and Dart for an annual workshop on information technology
- Worked closely with Professor Alon Orlitsky as part of a two-person team, engaging in frequent communication
- Redesigned and tested the splash screen and other in-app features using emulators for both Android and iOS
- Worked on the deployment of the mobile application on the App Store and Play Store after development

### 6. Mathematics Undergraduate Instructional Assistant
- Assisted Professors Hammock, Sarkar, Mackall, and Bach in maintaining an efficient learning environment for students
- Promptly and accurately graded weekly homework assignments which included MATLAB based assignments
- Provided constructive feedback to help students understand their mistakes, contributing to their academic growth
