## Projects

### 1. Full - Stack Web Developer
- Built a full-stack web app using Next.js, Tailwind CSS for the UI and Firebase for backend through custom API functions
- Employed an Agile software development process, managing sprints, gathering user feedback, and creating user stories to guide feature development and design.
- Integrated Firebase Authentication for secure Google-based sign-in and sign-up, with Firestore for real-time data storage and retrieval.
- Built a point-based task system where users could assign tasks, track progress, and unlock avatars as rewards.
- Added RSVP functionality for events, leveraging Firebase to show real-time attendee updates.
- Used GitHub for version control, managing structured commits, branch workflows, and collaborative code reviews.

### 2. User Rating Prediction Recommender System and Research Paper
- Conducted exploratory data analysis on a Food.com recipe and review dataset, identifying skews and key insights to guide predictive modeling.
- Pre-processed data by handling missing values, filtering sparse reviews and users, and ensuring data validity for robust predictions.
- Implemented Word2Vec similarity and SVD latent factor models to predict user ratings, optimizing hyperparameters and applying regularization to improve performance.
- Evaluated models using MSE, MAE, and RMSE, identified scalability challenges, and proposed future improvements based on comparisons with similar projects.

### 3. Web Developer
- Developed sticky note web application using React, enabling users to create, edit, delete, and filter notes, utilizing the useState hook for real-time state management.
- Implemented a to-do list app using React, allowing users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and dynamically update the UI based on user actions, improving task management efficiency.
- Integrated favorites toggle functionality in the sticky note app, providing users the ability to mark notes as important or remove them from the list, with seamless state transitions through React hooks.
- Built responsive web applications with interactive features such as filtering notes based on user input, enhancing the user experience by leveraging React's component-based architecture.
- Managed state across multiple components using useState, optimizing the performance and functionality of the web apps to improve user interaction and responsiveness.

### 4. App Developer – Golf Betting Application
- Used Flutter SDK and Dart to build an application about the Golf Nassau Betting System
- Used Firebase to build the database management system to store data and for authentication and security
- Designed the GUI using Flutter’s collection of widgets, working on both the backend and frontend

### 5. Huffman Encoding Tree for File Compression
- Built a Huffman encoding tree to perform file compression and decompression on file headers
- Implemented a file compression tool using the Huffman algorithm to reduce storage size without losing information
- Implemented a file decompression tool using the Huffman algorithm to get back the original file header
- Used a priority queue to further make the process more efficient
- Enhanced the efficiency of the compression by using bit-packing (3-bit integers) to store larger numbers in smaller sequences

### 6. Graph Class and Algorithms Implementation
- Implemented important graph algorithms to represent and analyze network
- Developed a Graph class to represent undirected graphs, applied to transmission clustering for HIV and COVID-19
- Utilized the graph to identify transmission clusters and gather information for virus spread prevention through graph
algorithms using BFS, Djikstra’s Algorithm, Connected Components, and Connecting Thresholds
